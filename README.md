# tools_sdl

This project is an experiment using SDL2 and GO.

I am building a framework for creating graphic games in GO and SDL2 is the only game in town at the moment.

However SDL2 is a bit of a nightmare to set up on windows so I would only recommend developing this on Linux.

There are guides to setting up SDL2 on the git hub SDL2 Go project.
